      <h1>This is me</h1>
      <p>I'm Stef, 28 years old. I live in the north of Antwerp with my fianc√©e in a house we are renovating. I am about to embark on this exciting journey of becoming a software developer. I'm a trained physiotherapist, but never grew to really enjoy it.
         After some career counseling, I started the Bachelor Applied Computer Science at KDG as a "flextraject" in 2021, combining it with my full-time job. But why not make a living, doing what I love?</p>
      <h1>Meet the Family</h1>
         <h2>Ellen</h2>
          <p>This is my girlfriend. We got engaged this summer. We met at a holiday camp from CM when we were sixteen and started singing in the same choir. She is a musical actress
            , hosts saturday school for inquisitive youth and co-runs a local children's choir. A real source of inspiration!</p>
         <h2>(King) Arthur</h2>
            <p>Our large, furry friend. Mostly lounges or surveys his kingdom from above. He will lay on the piano when we're playing and lay in the sink when we're in the bathroom.
              We think he likes us (providing for his every need).
            </p>
         <h2>Family</h2>
          <p>With four siblings, family gatherings are large events. My dad cooks up something great and we play boardgames. My youngest brother is a game dev in Germany.
            Another brother is an indie developer breaking into the gaming world with his ownz company. Software developing runs in the family, I guess.</p>
