        <h1>Music Theory</h1>
          <p>For my technical subject, I'd like to talk about what makes a song "good". You could say "because it sounds good.", and you would be absolutely right. I could stop writing right here.
          With music theory however, we like to delve a little deeper and try to explain why something actually sounds the way it sounds.
           As this is an insanely broad subject, I'd like to focus on one easily recognizable topic.</p>
      </header>
        <h2>Major vs. Minor</h2>
          <p>Even as a total music noob, you will instantly hear the difference. Songs in a major key tend to sound 'bright, happy, hopeful', while minor key songs sound "sad, gloomy, dejected".
          There are some obvious exceptions. Most people won't label EVERYBODY HURTS - R.E.M., a song in D major, as a happy song. Ironically, HAPPY - PHARELL WILLIAMS, is written in the key of F minor.
          This goes to show that a lot goes into the emotional quality of a song. Tempo, choice of instruments, lyrics,... all combine to make a song sound "happy" or "sad".
          In isolation though, major and minor keys are associated with joy and sadness, respectively. But there is nothing inherently sad or joyful about music. It's just air vibrating at different frequencies. Why then do we assign these emotions to songs?
          To understand this, first we have to explain the technical difference between a major and minor scale.</p>
          <h3>The major scale</h3>
            <p>This scale is made out of seven notes (eight if you repeat the first at the end). Every note is a whole step away from the last, except for the fourth and the eight.
            If you play the white keys on a piano, starting on C, you get the C major scale. (Half steps between E-F and B-C)</p>
          <h3>The minor scale</h3>
          <p>There are actually three types of minor scales. To keep it simple, we only talk about the natural minor scale here.
            This scale also consists of seven (or eight) notes. The only difference is the occurence of the half steps: here the third and sixth are a half step away from the previous note. </p>
        <h2>Chords</h2>
        <p>The building blocks of almost all songs are chords: three or more notes played together. They are built based on the scales mentioned above.
          C major (C-E-G) consists of three notes from the C major scale. C minor (C-Eflat-G) is built off of the C minor scale. Only the middle note differs: Eflat is half a step lower than E.
          This half step difference has a big impact: most people clearly hear the emotional difference between the two chords.
          Most of the chords (that actually drive the harmony) used in major songs are major chords, while minor songs mostly use minor chords.
          But we still don't know why a minor chord (and thus a song in a minor key) sounds "sad".</p>
        <h2>Nature vs. nurture</h2>
        <p>The same debate exists in behavioural science, biology, sociology,... Is a trait acquired (nurture) or are we born with it (nature)?
           In music theory, we might make a case for both.</p>
           <h3>Nurture</h3>
            <p>Go back a thousand years, and major and minor keys weren't widely used in western music. Journey a couple of thousand miles, and major and minor keys are not widely used even today.
              And if they are, locals don't have the same emotional connection to the keys as westerners tend to do.
              Traditional Asian music is built off of a five-note scale and so does not incorporate major and minor keys, while Nigerian martial anthems are mostly in a key western music would consider "minor". It would be silly to suggest
              modern Asians or classical Greeks don't/didn't feel happy or sad emotions when listening to a traditional song or most Nigerians feel dejected when listening to a marial anthem.
              This goes to show that there is a strong cultural aspect to experiencing music. We are taught to feel a certain way, listening to a certain song.
              Frodo is vibing in the Shire on a song in a major key and gets packaged as food by a giant spider on ominous strings playing a song in a minor key.
              There Comes the Bride is major and the Funeral March is minor. Yoda's theme is major, Vader's theme is minor. As music is ubiquitous, this conditioning starts at a very young age.
            </p>
            <aside>What about X and Y, rewritten to their relative minor and major? Do your cultural expectations of these songs color your reactions in any way?</aside>
           <h3>Nature</h3>
           <p>Sound is air vibrating. Air vibrating at a higher frequency will have a higher pitch.
              But, excluding pure sine waves, a musical note will vibrate at multiple frequencies! If I play the note C on the piano, you will hear it's fundamental frequency: the note C.
              However, multiple higher frequencies will occur simultaneously. These "overtones" form the harmonic series and happen across all instruments.
              Ever noticed a C played on the piano actually sounds very different compared to the same note on a trumpet? This is a consequence of different relative strengths of the overtones in these instruments.
              This is also known as the "timbre" of an instrument. The exact notes in this harmonic series have some huge implications.
              The most interesting for our discussion: only the three notes of the C major chord occur in the six overtones of the note C.
              The major key seems to have a direct basis in physics. Music theorists argue that these major key thus naturally get associated with "stability, consonance, normalcy".
              All is well in the world of the major chord. It follows that minor keys, straying from this natural order, get associated with "instability, dissonance, unease".
            </p>
          <p>I actually lied in the opening paragraph: music theory can't explain why a song sounds good. It can only help to explain why it sounds the way it sounds.
          It is a tool to be used in your own composing. If you want to evoke emotions of longing, melancholy or sadness, it's probably a safe bet to compose in a minor key.
          You can consciously choose to break this "rule", however.
          Your choice will have more chance to achieve it's intended goal when you are actually aware of the rule you're breaking and how you go about it.
           Knowing what is happening in a song can also immensely further your enjoyment of it. </p>
