      <h1>Piano & Singing</h1>
        <p>I take weekly piano and composition lessons and play in a jazz ensemble. I have a soft spot for video game music. Combine the two and you get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4OxmD4AocU">my favourite music genre</a>
          Together with my teacher, I composed the music for my brother's graduation project. </p>
      <h1>Sports</h1>
        <p>Because of my paramedical background, I like to keep fit. Soccer, bouldering, hiking... As long as it has a social and/or nature component.
           As a developer, I expect my screentime to rise (even more). I'd like to balance this out with the above.</p>
      <h1>Personal Finance</h1>
        <p>Ah... spreadsheets. They hold a special place in my heart. Maximizing your income, aligning your spending with your values and investing the difference.
        This with the ultimate goal of one day becoming financially independent.</p>
